          ### Methodologies



          There are plenty of [methodologies](https://github.com/ikkou/awesome-css#architecture) out there which aimed on reducing CSS codebase and organizing programmers cooperation and maintaining of CSS code. This is obvious in large projects like Twitter, Facebook and [Github](http://markdotto.com/2014/07/23/githubs-css/#two-bundles), but other projects often grows into same “Huge CSS file” state pretty quickly.

          > The reason I choose BEM over other methodologies comes down to this: it's less confusing than the other methods (i.e. SMACSS) but still provides us the good architecture we want (i.e. OOCSS) and with a recognisable terminology.

          > BEM succeeds because it provides a good object oriented structure with a familiar terminology and is simple enough to not get in your way.

          > Unlike OOCss, it doesn’t aim at total modularity, but the opposite: namespacing (through classes names), creating independent modules of css code that don’t interact with each other.

          > To me, independent modules is a simpler approach and while it fails to provide the modularity of OOCss, it gives easier to manage files.

          ### Example

          We are prepearing little turtorial on "How to migrate existing project to BEM". In meanwhile you can watch nice presentation by Nicole Sullivan — "[CSS preprocessor performance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NDyopLKE1w)". It gives a very good explanation of problems, that she meets in major of sites and ways to track and handle them.
