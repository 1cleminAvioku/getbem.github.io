            To start using BEM you only need to know about [BEM naming conventions](http://cssguidelin.es/#bem-like-naming). We recommend using `_` and `__` as delimeters for Elements and Modificators. After you have Blocks and Elements on your page, you can reorganize your CSS files.

            We grouping Blocks into directories, that called `Layers`. Because of Blocks are independent inside one Layer, CSS files in Layer directory can be concatinated without ordering.

            Building static site with BEM is easy &mdash; you just need to concatinate CSS files with respect of layers ordering.
